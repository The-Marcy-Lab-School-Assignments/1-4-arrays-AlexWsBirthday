# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
  return nameToChange; //needs this
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer

Inside the changeName function, you change the argument specifically to 'Tom' but don't return it. You aren't making the function show how it changed the name that was passed through it as an argument. Since strings are immutable, you need to create a new string to 'replace' the original name string with, and return it. Since arrays are mutable, you don't need to return a whole new array.
