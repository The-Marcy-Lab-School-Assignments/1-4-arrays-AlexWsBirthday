# Question

Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer

The spread operator "expand" an array into its elements, meaning that the properties of an array are "spread out" to be seen rather than condensed all into one element of an array (what the rest operator does).
